          <p>I'm so excited to apply for the IT Project Manager position at Weniger Aerospace.

 

At A/G Systems, I saved 10 meeting hours a week for 20 engineers. I did it by automating our program requirements management with Oracle Primavera. At $90 an hour, that’s $864,000 saved per year. I'm proud of that—not least because my title wasn't "IT PMP" but "Program Administrator." Transitioning to 100% IT PMP at Weniger would use my IT skills and passion to the full.</p>
